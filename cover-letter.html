			<p>Dear Hiring Manager(s):</p>
	
			<p>I am writing to express my interest in your <b>Engineering Intern</b> position for Summer 2025. I was first introduced to TechSmith when researching screen recording tools for a small YouTube channel of mine. I was impressed by <b>Snagit</b>’s suite of features, accessibility, and longevity, so I decided to peek behind the company curtain.</p>

			<p>I am currently a <b>Computer Science</b> undergraduate, finishing my junior Spring semester at <b>Pennsylvania Western University</b>, Edinboro. During the past five years, I have studied software development from an application and web perspective, and through my university program I have completed a Data Structures course focusing on <b>Python</b>, a Structured Programming course utilizing <b>C++</b>, two <b>Java</b> courses, a Database Design course, and a Computer Graphics course, among others. I have extensive experience working with full-stack web development, including <b>JavaScript</b> libraries and more complex frameworks like <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>Electron</b>. I would be comfortable demonstrating these qualities in an interview setting utilizing programs like <b>Google Cloud</b> and <b>Kubernetes</b>. Furthermore, I have recently experimented with <b>.NET 8.0</b> on small-scale Linux projects, and hope to sharpen my skill in practicum.</p>
			
			<p>During this period in my life, I am looking to absorb pragmatic, creative technologies that will carry my work into the future. I highly respect TechSmith’s services, and an internship program would expose me to a collaborative work environment that would allow me to practice my development strategies in a professional context. I would be most comfortable with an <b>in-person/hybrid</b> experience at the Michigan office, but a remote offering would be appreciated as well.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role.</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Best regards,</i><br>
				Shawn Gallagher
