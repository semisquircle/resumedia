				<p class="question">How does your academic history and other life experiences align with this internship?</p>
				<p>As a child, I was convinced that computers were magic. I used to sit at my father’s iMac in our family room and marvel at the monitor displaying even the most benign imagery, like a screensaver. <i>How could something so complex inhabit such a small package? Might this be proof of witchcraft, or a divine creator?</i> Perhaps I wasn’t quite that articulate. But I became a Computer Science major primarily to answer these kinds of questions through empirical research. I've spent six years studying technology down to the electrons, three of which in a college setting, mainly concerned with developing desktop and internet software. While this category of programming has improved my problem-solving and supplemented my creative endeavors, I believe it to be most instrumental for me to transition into physical computer engineering for my long-term occupation. Furthermore, I have found that many of my peers avoid physical research, and turn a blind eye to entire categories of resolvable social issues in lieu of chasing jobs at California’s Big Five tech firms.</p>
				<p>Pushing against this trend, I would like to orient my career towards more local East Coast initiatives that incorporate pragmatic, engineering research. As such, I approach this internship from a more technological perspective rather than a bionomics one. I am mainly interested in the Technology in Ecology lab, as a platform to experiment with real-world computer engineering. To support this endeavor, I have developed proficiency in technologies that will likely be used within the lab, including object-oriented programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB, as well as breadboarding and microcontroller firmware.</p>
				<p>This semester, I received a scholarship grant through PennWest for a research project involving a motion sensing Arduino remote. The aim is to investigate how an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can be utilized for text input on distant displays. It will accompany a participant study culminating in April, as well as a written publication by myself and my academic advisor. The prospect of using Arduino</p>

				<p>devices within the Technology in Ecology lab is what initially drew me to SERC; working with this kind of open source hardware would be a great way to strengthen the skills I’m already familiar with while dipping my feet into more large-scale data modeling.</p>

				<p class="question">What do you hope to learn through this internship and how would it relate to your academic and career goals?</p>
				<p>An internship at SERC would satisfy two major goals of mine. The first goal is to become up close and personal with sensor technologies, primarily solar and rainfall. Many people in my class and social circle claim to care about environmental issues, yet they do very little to tackle the root cause. I mostly attribute this to a barrier of entry; solar panels are costly (even in educational settings) and hydrology often warrants even more extensive resources. I've long wanted to experiment in these fields but lacked the necessary equipment, space, or personnel. However, SERC provides advanced laboratory hardware specifically for these pursuits. The second goal is to gain mentorship in publishing scientific articles, as I believe it's crucial to familiarize myself with the manuscript writing process, explore suitable journals, and submit my findings for peer review.</p>

				<p class="question">What environmental science topics are you most interested in?</p>
				<p>I am most interested in interdisciplinary topics like green computing, e-waste management, and biodegradable electronics. Outside of computing, environmental science has provided me with the richest educational insights, stemming from an AP Environmental Science class in high school, two biology labs alongside an Honors-level paleontology course at Bloomsburg University, and most recently a sustainability course entitled “People and the Planet” at Pennsylvania Western University.</p>			
	
				<div class="separator"></div>
				
				<p class="question">Why are you interested in an internship at SERC?</p>
				<p>I've found that technology has a dual nature in the environmental context: it stems from carbon-producing industries and wasteful manufacturing, yet computers remain one of our key tools for analyzing CO2 data. Aside from petroleum and natural gas firms, computer companies are the largest sources of GHG emissions worldwide. The solution to this problem will not be found in data centers</p>

				<p>or AI chatbots; engineers must get their hands dirty analyzing how the natural world actually operates and replenishes its resources.</p>
				<p>In closing, my main preference would be to join others in-person at Edgewater this summer. The intern program offers an opportunity for individual research, complemented by monetary resources—an aspect I find rare and not necessarily available through other options at my university. From my understanding, Technology in Ecology’s currently active projects include PathFinder, GENX, TEMPEST, SMARTX, and MERIT. I’ve referenced the lab’s sensing protocols and would be enthusiastic to contribute to any of these projects as an intern technician on-site, but I would also be interested in any remote offerings. Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role.</p>
